**Motivation & Goals**
Analyzing rental car data on the most popular automobile colors is driven by the goal of effectively meeting customer demand and optimizing fleet management. The car rental company may improve customer satisfaction, streamline inventory, and effectively allocate resources by knowing which colors are most frequently rented out. The goals involve identifying trends in color preferences among various demographic groups and geographic regions, optimizing marketing strategies to promote preferred colors, and adjusting procurement and inventory management protocols accordingly. By ensuring that the car composition reflects customer preferences, this study will boost operational effectiveness and encourage revenue growth. The results of the analysis can also be used to inform choices concerning customer experience initiatives, branding, and car purchases, all of which can increase the company's competitive edge. The main question that will be addressed is:
“What color cars are rented most often?”


**Source OLTP schema**
The four tables that make up the database structure are Rating, Car, Rental, and Customer. Each car is uniquely identified by its Car_ID, and the automobile Table has information on individual automobiles. The Rental Table keeps track of rental transactions by identifying which vehicle was hired for each transaction. It is connected to the automobile Table using the Car_ID foreign key .Each customer is assigned a unique Customer_ID, and customer data is kept in the Customer Table. The Rental Table uses the Customer_ID foreign key to access the Customer Table and associate each rental transaction with a specific customer. Lastly, the Rating Table contains client feedback about their rental experiences. The foreign key Rental_ID associates every rating with a rental.

**Dimensions & Facts of DW**
The fact table, Facts_Rental, includes the rental price as a quantitative measure. Surrounding it are dimensions like Dimension_CustomerRental, providing demographic context, Dimension_Time for temporal analysis of color trends, Dimension_CarRental with car attributes including color for preference analysis, and Dimension_RatingRental for customer feedback on color choices. This setup, following a snowflake schema, efficiently analyzes color preferences to meet demand, optimize fleet management, and enhance operational effectiveness.

**View in MySQL**
The following query creates a view named ‘view_most_popular_colors_2020’ within the car_rental schema. The view is structured to display the most popular colors based on rental frequency for the year 2020. It does this by selecting the color of the car and two calculated fields: the total numbers of times cars of a particular color have been rented (‘rental_count’) and the total revenue generated from each color (‘total_revenue’). The revenue is calculated by multiplying the rental price per day by the duration of the rental in days, summed for all rentals of that particular color. The query selects only for data between 01/01/2020 to 31/12/2020. The results are grouped by color and ordered by ‘rental_count’ so that the most frequent color appears at the top. The revenue is added to provide insight into how much each color contributes to the revenue in absolute terms. The output shows that cars with crimson color were most popular in the year 2020, but the second most popular option, turquoise, brought the most revenue.
